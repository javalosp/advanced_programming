This repository contains suplemmentary material for lectures 2, 4, 7 and 9. This material includes:

* **Lecture handouts**: Brief documents summarising key concepts for each lecture.
* **Lecture examples**: Supplementary examples and exercises.
* **Lecture quizzes** 

The Lecture handouts and the Lecture examples are written in `.tex` files, making use of the `minted` package for code rendering. 

The quizzes are written in Markdown format, allowing for interactive solutions. For a better interaction experience it is recommended to use VScode with the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension.
